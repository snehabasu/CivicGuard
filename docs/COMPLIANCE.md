# Compliance & Safety Boundaries

## HIPAA-Oriented Principles
- Minimum necessary data processing
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Least-privilege access controls
- Full access and change auditing

## AI Output Controls
- Structured output schema validation
- Hallucination reduction via source-grounded prompts
- Explicit confidence markers for uncertain fields
- Human approval before final submission

## Security Backlog
1. Signed consent capture and linkage
2. Redaction pipeline for exported artifacts
3. Tenant isolation and key management
4. Tamper-evident audit log chain
